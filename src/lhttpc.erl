%% @doc Sends a request with a body.
%% `URL' is expected to be a valid URL: 
%% `scheme://host[:port][/path]'.
%% `Method' is either a string, stating the HTTP method exactly as in the
%% protocol, i.e: `"POST"' or `"GET"'. It could also be an atom, which is
%% then made in to uppercase, if it isn't already.
%% `Hdrs' is a list of headers to send. Mandatory headers such as
%% `Host', `Content-Length' or `Transfer-Encoding' (for some requests) 
%% are added.
%% `Body' is the entity to send in the request. Please don't include entity
%% bodies where there shouldn't be any (such as for `GET').
%% `Timeout' is the timeout for the request in milliseconds.
%% `Options' is a list of options.
%%
%% Options:
%%
%% `{connect_timeout, Milliseconds}' specifies how many milliseconds the
%% client can spend trying to establish a connection to the server. This
%% doesn't affect the overall request timeout. However, if it's longer than
%% the overall timeout it will be ignored. Also note that the TCP layer my
%% choose to give up earlier than the connect timeout, in which case the
%% client will also give up. The default value is infinity, which means that
%% it will either give up when the TCP stack gives up, or when the overall
%% request timeout is reached. 
%%
%% `{send_retry, N}' specifies how many times the client should retry
%% sending a request if the connection is closed after the data has been
%% sent. The default value is `1'. If `{partial_upload, WindowSize}'
%% (see below) is specified, the client cannot retry after the first part
%% of the body has been sent since it doesn't keep the whole entitity body
%% in memory.
%%
%% `{partial_upload, WindowSize}' means that the body will be supplied in
%% parts to the client by the calling process. The `WindowSize' specifies how
%% many parts can be sent to the process controlling the socket before waiting
%% for an acknowledgement. This is to create a kind of internal flow control
%% if the network is slow and the process is blocked by the TCP stack. Flow
%% control is disabled if `WindowSize' is `infinity'. If `WindowSize' is an
%% integer, it must be >= 0.  If partial upload is specified and no
%% `Content-Length' is specified in `Hdrs' the client will use chunked
%% transfer encoding to send the entity body. If a content length is
%% specified, this must be the total size of the entity body.
%% The call to {@link request/6} will return `{ok, UploadState}'. The
%% `UploadState' is supposed to be used as the first argument to the {@link
%% send_body_part/2} or {@link send_body_part/3} functions to send body parts.
%% Partial upload is intended to avoid keeping large request bodies in
%% memory but can also be used when the complete size of the body isn't known
%% when the request is started.
