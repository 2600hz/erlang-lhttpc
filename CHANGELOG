Version 1.2.0:
* Add support for options
    * {connect_timeout, Milliseconds}: Aborts the connect phase after Milliseconds
    * {send_retry, N}: The client will retry sending the request N times if the connection is closed
* Add support for downloading chunked transfer encoding
* More consistent error handling
    * The client can either return {ok, Result} or {error, Reason}. Reason wasn't very well defined before
        * connection_closed: The server closed the connection on us (N times in case it happens just after sending the request) 
        * connect_timeout: If the TCP stack gives up or we hit the connect_timeout option
        * timeout: If the overall request timeout value is hit
    * All other errors (socket, protocol etc. will result in a runtime error)
* Better connection handling (issues #2 and #3 on bitbucket.org/etc/lhttpc)
    * Now understands what to do with connections to servers < HTTP/1.1
    * Now respects "Connection: close" in request headers, which means
      clients can choose to not use persistent connections
* RFC Compliance
    * Fix reading of chunked encoding since section 3.6 claims that "All transfer-coding values are case-insensitive"
    * Support for responses that doesn't have an entity body 
        * No body for the HEAD and OPTIONS (unless indicated for the latter) methods
        * Don't try to read a body when receiving a 204 status

* Fix minor error with {active, once} instead of {active, true} in manager
* Remove socket and try to find another if the manager can't set controlling process due to socket error
* Improve test suite 

Version 1.1.1:
* Fix problem with empty lists in dicts when last socket is consumed
* Improve test suite to include cover report 

Version 1.1.0:
